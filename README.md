# Developers

The [Developers Portal](https://developers.umweltify.com) is your gateway to integrating sustainability into your apps and games. As part of the Umweltify Ecosystem, this platform empowers developers and companies to make a meaningful environmental impact while enhancing user engagement. Developers can define their apps/games in the platform and introduce them through the "[ClimateIn](broken-reference)" initiative as a climate-friendly app/game.

### What is the Developers Portal?

The Developers Portal is designed to enable app and game developers to:

3. **Provide In-App/In-Game Incentives**: Reward "green" users with exclusive in-app or in-game benefits, encouraging others to adopt green electricity practices. This fosters an eco-conscious community and boosts engagement.
4. **Measure & Decarbonize Value Chain Emissions**: Use provided data and tools to quantify emissions in your value chain and create actionable plans to reduce them, aligning with sustainability goals.
